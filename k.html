<h1>On Sonnets and Kolmogorov Compressors</h1>

<p><time datetime="2024-06-15">June 15, 2024</time></p>

<p>Sonorous sonnets bloom as bluebonnets,<br>
Flawlessly sprawling each phrase upon its<br>
Blossoming tapestry of majesty<br>
Without strictly speaking of travesty<br>
When to do so would dull by rote let-on<br>
Those thorns that imply a far sharper con,<br>
As in a sin-pro sort of shallow praise,<br>
Outlining emptiness in purple phrase.<br>
I prefer chatspeak unkempt and succinct,<br>
Straight, to-the-point, digital and distinct;<br>
Logographers reformed Homeric song;<br>
I find the form of the sonnet too strong,<br>
And long for lit zingers, words infodense:<br>
Let's let the context's compression commence ðŸ”¥</p>
