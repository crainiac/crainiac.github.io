  <h1>Learning a Desire Simulator</h1>

  <p>"The goal of religious thinking is exactly the same as that of technological research -- namely, practical action."</p>

  <p>I love the idea that God communicates with us through nature.</p>

  <p>Man-made communication media are not nature. The media are controlled by humans.</p>

  <p>I want that to change. I want the media to be more like nature: beautiful, self-organizing, humblingly vast, and able to adapt well past our grasp.</p>

  <p>The best way to achieve this is to automate all media.</p>

  <p>The ideal media algorithm should require only one bit of feedback per experience (e.g., a video frame): Is this what you wanted or not? It should use this feedback to get better at generating media that you want.</p>

  <p>Want to be entertained? Let's design a media creation agent to produce video frames with maximal entertainment value. Today, the most entertaining media creators are human, so it makes sense to think about how they work (and the world in which their work manifests, like your face as you read this media).</p>

  <p>Some human media creators have brains; our creation agent may implement some functions of those brains. Here's an attempt:</p>
  <pre>
neocortex: creative process/action space (markov decision process)
thalamus: action space/action generator (language model cascades)
basal ganglia: action generator/belief updater (thompson sampling)
hippocampus: belief updater/historical data (RAG system)
amygdala: constraint data/observation data (economic model)
nerves: observation data/observation metalanguage (world simulator)
  </pre>
  <p>With this stack, our agent can execute a sequence of creative actions (e.g., prompt generation, prompt revision, image generation) to produce a terminal observation (e.g., an entertaining video frame) and learn to take better actions based on feedback. A logical next step is to make the learning more end-to-end.</p>

  <p>The first time you skydive, you need to go in tandem with an instructor. That's not because it's hard to work a parachute: it's because you are still learning to model the environment of a freefall. As <a href="https://github.com/commaai/commavq">comma</a> did for the road, wirehead should learn a simulator for people getting what they want.</p>

  <p>"Make something people want" is a mantra. "Simulate people wanting something" is a goal: if you can solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory">desire</a>, you just might solve life.</p>
