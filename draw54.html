  <h1>Draw-54</h1>

  <p><time datetime="2018-08-19">August 19, 2018</time></p>

  <p>A game begins with a shuffled deck of 54 cards numbered 2â€“10 (10 2s, 9 3s, &hellip;, 2 10s). For each odd-numbered card that you draw, you gain that number of dollars times five billion; for each even-numbered card that you draw, you lose that number of dollars times six billion. You cannot look at a card unless you draw it. You must draw at least one card and then may stop drawing anytime to end the game. Cards are drawn without replacement, so exhausting the deck will also end the game. Assume optimal play.</p>

  <ol>
      <li>To the nearest cent, how much money do you expect to lose by playing?</li>
      <li>Now assume that you can slip more 3s into the deck before shuffling and starting the game. What's the minimum number of 3s that you must add to the deck such that you can expect to win money by playing?</li>
  </ol>

  <button onclick="toggleSolution()">Solution</button>
  <div id="solution" class="hidden">
    <p>Consider \(k\) card types with counts in the deck \(n_1, \ldots, n_k\) and values \(v_1, \ldots, v_k\).</p>

    <p>Let \(N_i\), \(1 \leq i \leq k\), be the count of the \(i\)th card type in the deck at the beginning of the game. Our expected value when all cards have been drawn \(\mathbb{E}(0, \ldots, 0) = 0\); from there, we must backward-induct to \(\mathbb{E}(N_1, \ldots, N_k)\). The recursion \(\mathbb{E}(n_1, \ldots, n_k) = \max \left(0, \sum_{i=1}^{k}{(\mathbb{E}(n_1, \ldots, n_i - 1, \ldots, n_k) + v_i) \mathbb{P}(n_i)} \right)\) accounts for optimal stopping, where the probability of drawing a type-\(i\) card \(\mathbb{P}(n_i) = \frac{n_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{k}n_j}\). \((n_i < 0: \mathbb{E}(n_1, \ldots, n_i, \ldots n _k) = 0.)\)</p>

    <p>1. The dynamic programming approach takes time \(\Theta\left(\prod_{i=1}^{k}N_i\right)\). Since we must draw at least one card, we obtain the expected value with auxiliary \(\widehat{\mathbb{E}}(N_1, \ldots, N_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{(\mathbb{E}(N_1, \ldots, N_i - 1, \ldots, N_k) + v_i) \mathbb{P}(N_i)}\).</p>

    <p>2. We want to find the minimal \(N_m\) such that \(\mathbb{E}(N_1, \ldots, N_m, \ldots, N_k) > 0\). \(N_m\) is bounded above at \(\widehat{N}_m = 1 - \sum_{i \neq m} \frac{v_i N_i}{v_m}\), and the expected value is a nondecreasing function of \(n_m\), so we can backward-induce \(N_m\) in time \(\Omega\left(\prod_{i \neq m} N_i\right)\) and \(O\left(\widehat{N}_m \prod_{i \neq m} N_i\right)\). Given subsolutions to \(\mathbb{E}(N_1, \ldots, \widehat{N}_m, \ldots, N_k)\), we could find \(N_m\) by binary search in \(O(\log \widehat{N}_m)\), \(\Omega(1)\) time.</p>
  <p>Here's an implementation for the numbers given in the problem statement:</p>

#!/usr/bin/env python3
from functools import lru_cache

def expect(counts, values):
    return 0 if any(n < 0 for n in counts) or not any(counts) else max(
        0,
        sum((expect(counts[:i] + (n - 1, ) + counts[i + 1:], values) + v) * n
            for i, (n, v) in enumerate(zip(counts, values))) / sum(counts))
# 1)
N = tuple(range(10, 1, -1))
VALUES = tuple(c * 5e9 if c % 2 else -c * 6e9 for c in range(2, 11))
EXPECT_HAT = sum((expect(N[:i] + (N[i] - 1, ) + N[i + 1:], VALUES) + v) * n
                 for i, (n, v) in enumerate(zip(N, VALUES))) / sum(N)
print('${:,.2f}'.format(EXPECT_HAT))  # $-4,059,165,310.65
# 2)
N_HAT = 1 - sum(n * v for n, v in zip(N, VALUES) if v != VALUES[1]) / VALUES[1]
for n_m in range(int(N_HAT)):
    if expect((N[0], n_m) + N[2:], VALUES) > 0:
        print(n_m - N[1])  # 4
        break
